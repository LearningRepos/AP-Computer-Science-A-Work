## AP-Computer-Science-A-Work

This repo is my code for AP Computer Science A (aka CS 101 equivalent) which was my first programming intensive course in which I covered OOP and basic data structures like Arrays/ArrayLists/2D Arrays and algorithms like Recursion and Sorting.

## Installation

Just clone the repo and use your IDE (I used IntelliJ and VSCode) to run the main java file in the subdirectories with decimal points(Not 9 or 12 but 9.04 or 12.09).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mihir-Achyuta/AP-Computer-Science-A-Work.git
```

## Example Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mihir-Achyuta/AP-Computer-Science-A-Work.git
cd AP-Computer-Science-A-Work
cd Ch9
cd 9.04
code .
```

## What I Learnt

AP Computer Science A has a standardized syllabus on CollegeBoard with all the content so I will link it here
